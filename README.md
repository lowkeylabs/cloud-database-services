Comparison of free cloud services

## Microsoft Azure free account
If you don't already have an Azure account, you can sign up for a free account. You'll get a mix of services — some free forever, some for the first year — including several cloud databases.  See:

    https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/

A free Azure account comes with a *$200 credit to spend in the first 30 days*, which you could use to pay for a database if you only need it for a short period. However, many services are free and are available for 12-months after your account is created.

Azure for MySQL is free for 12-months, for modest applications:  750 hours of Flexible Server—Burstable B1MS Instance, 32 GB storage, and 32 GB backup storage.

If you start with an Azure free account, you have to explicitly opt-in to a paid account, so there’s no risk of surprise charges. You have to opt in to a paid account after 30 days; after that, your services stop working and data is deleted. If you do go for the paid solution, you can set up a spending limit to keep your bill manageable.

Good for semester-long data base class? YES! MySQL is available for 12-months.

## Google Cloud Free Tier
If you don't already have a Google Cloud account (gmail doesn't count), you can sign up for a free trial. This includes a $300 credit to spend in the first 90 days, which you could use to run a short-lived database. See:

    https://cloud.google.com/free

You have to upgrade to a paid account after 90 days or when your credits run out; after that, your data is deleted. There’s no way to enforce a hard spending limit if you upgrade, so be careful about what you spin up — this could leave you with an unexpected bill.

The Google Cloud Free Tier includes 1GB of storage with Cloud Firestore, a NoSQL document database.  

Google Cloud offers a MySQL product:

This is NOT in the free tier, but does qualify for the 90 day/$300 credit offering.

Good for semester-long database class? MAYBE! Be careful to sign up within 90 days of the end of the class, mid-September at the earliest. This will ensure that your work doesn't disappear during finals week!

## Not recommended: AWS Free Tier
AWS requires a credit card. Ouch.
